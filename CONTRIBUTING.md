# Hello, World!

Thanks for your interest in making Metasploit -- and therefore, the
world -- a better place!

Are you about to report a bug? If so, please use our [Redmine Bug
Tracker](https://dev.metasploit.com/redmine/projects/framework). An
account is required but it only takes a minute or two.

Are you about to report a security vulnerability in Metasploit?
If so, please take a look at Rapid's [Vulnerability
Disclosure Policy](https://www.rapid7.com/disclosure.jsp) policy.

Are you about to contribute some new functionality, a bug fix, or a new
Metasploit module? If so, read on...

# Contributing to Metasploit

What you see here in CONTRIBUTING.md is a bullet-point list of the do's
and don'ts of how to make sure *your* valuable contributions actually
make it into Metasploit's master branch.

If you care not to follow these rules, your contribution **will** be
closed (*Road House* style). Sorry!

This is intended to be a **short** list. The
[wiki](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki) is much more
exhaustive and reveals many mysteries. If you read nothing else, take a
look at the standard [development environment setup
guide](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Setting-Up-a-Metasploit-Development-Environment)
and Metasploit's [Common Coding Mistakes](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Common-Metasploit-Module-Coding-Mistakes).

## Code Contributions

* **Do** stick to the [Ruby style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide).
* *Do* get [Rubocop](https://rubygems.org/search?query=rubocop) relatively quiet against the code you are adding or modifying.
* **Do** follow the [50/72 rule](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) for Git commit messages.
* **Do** create a [topic branch](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows#Topic-Branches) to work on instead of working directly on `master`.

### Pull Requests

* **Do** target your pull request to the **master branch**. Not staging, not develop, not release.
* **Do** specify a descriptive title to make searching for your pull request easier.
* **Do** include [console output](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown#fenced-code-blocks), especially for witnessable effects in `msfconsole`.
* **Do** list [verification steps](https://help.github.com/articles/writing-on-github#task-lists) so your code is testable.
* **Don't** leave your pull request description blank.
* **Don't** abandon your pull request. Being responsive helps us land your code faster.

Pull requests [#2940](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/2940) and [#3043](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/3043) are a couple good examples to follow.

#### New Modules

* **Do** run `tools/msftidy.rb` against your module and fix any errors or warnings that come up. Even better would be to set up `msftidy.rb` as a [pre-commit hook](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/tools/dev/pre-commit-hook.rb).
* **Do** use the [many module mixin APIs](https://dev.metasploit.com/api/). Wheel improvements are welcome; wheel reinventions, not so much.
* **Don't** include more than one module per pull request.

#### Library Code

* **Do** write [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) tests - even the smallest change in library land can thoroughly screw things up.
* **Do** follow [Better Specs](http://betterspecs.org/) - it's like the style guide for specs.
* **Do** write [YARD](http://yardoc.org/) documentation - this makes it easier for people to use your code.
* **Don't** fix a lot of things in one pull request. Small fixes are easier to validate.

#### Bug Fixes

* **Do** include reproduction steps in the form of verification steps.
* **Do** include a link to the corresponding [Redmine](https://dev.metasploit.com/redmine/projects/framework) issue in the format of `SeeRM #1234` in your commit description.

## Bug Reports

* **Do** report vulnerabilities in Rapid7 software directly to security@rapid7.com.
* **Do** create a Redmine account and report your non-vulnerability bugs there.
* **Do** write a detailed description of your bug and use a descriptive title.
* **Do** include reproduction steps, stack traces, and anything else that might help us verify and fix your bug.
* **Don't** file duplicate reports - search for your bug before filing a new report.
* **Don't** report a bug on GitHub. Use [Redmine](https://dev.metasploit.com/redmine/projects/framework) instead.

Redmine issues [#8762](https://dev.metasploit.com/redmine/issues/8762) and [#8764](https://dev.metasploit.com/redmine/issues/8764) are a couple good examples to follow.

If you need some more guidance, talk to the main body of open
source contributors over on the [Freenode IRC channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23metasploit&uio=d4)
or e-mail us at [metasploit-hackers](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/metasploit-hackers)
mailing list.

Also, **thank you** for taking the few moments to read this far! You're
already way ahead of the curve, so keep it up!
